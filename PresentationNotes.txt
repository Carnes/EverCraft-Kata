Level Set
=========
- interupt us
- all level sessions so
  + we'll cover some basics
    - but not too deep
  + if your an expert then feel free to ignore us
- not here to sell you on TDD and Pairing
  + the practice should do that
  + we will tell you how -- the benefits you will experience
- language agnostic

Overview of Kata (i.e. the What)
================================
- what's a Kata and why do we do them?
  + audience answers
  + paint the fence Daniel-san

  + tell the story
    - better kata
    - game idea from Tim Wingenfield
    - George and I land on a whopper
  + point of kata is bigger and meatier than Bowling or Prime Factors
- role-playing (as product owners not with dice)
  + we will be the product owners
  + you will be the expert developers
    - building the domain model
- but we're picky
  + we demand TDD and Pairing

TDD
===
- explain the past
  + bad old days
  + unit testing
  + TDD compliments of Kent Beck
- explain the process
  + red
  + green
  + refactor

Ping Pong Paring

- added benefit - no rat holes

Dos & Don'ts
============

Exercise Notes
==============
- coding the model only
- no dice (it complicates things and distracts from the purpose)
- ask questions
  + as product owners we don't always know what we want
  + as workshop facilitators we likely have gaps in out cards
- starter projects are on github
  + and on these thumb drives

Pair Up
=======
- point out experts until group is evenly divided
  + encourage pairing with experts
- ask about languages
  + Ruby, Java, .NET, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Clojure, Scala, Groovy, Dart... nevermind!
  + any others?
- everyone pairs up and then
  + handout time!
